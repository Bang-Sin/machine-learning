# State Farm Distracted Driver Detection
https://www.kaggle.com/c/state-farm-distracted-driver-detection



# Download and unzip the data sets:
(https://www.kaggle.com/c/state-farm-distracted-driver-detection/data)

• imgs.zip - zipped folder of all (train/test) images
https://www.kaggle.com/c/state-farm-distracted-driver-detection/download/imgs.zip
• sample_submission.csv - a sample submission file in the correct format
https://www.kaggle.com/c/state-farm-distracted-driver-detection/download/sample_submission.csv.zip
• driver_imgs_list.csv - a list of training images, their subject (driver) id, and class id
https://www.kaggle.com/c/state-farm-distracted-driver-detection/download/driver_imgs_list.csv.zip

1. Put the train data set 'imgs/train' near to distracted_driver_detection.ipynb
2. Put the test data set 'imgs/test' to **'imgs/test/test'** near to distracted_driver_detection.ipynb
3. Create 'submission' folder near to distracted_driver_detection.ipynb for store output results of CNN models.
4. Create 'saved_models' folder near to distracted_driver_detection.ipynb for store models with the best validation loss.
